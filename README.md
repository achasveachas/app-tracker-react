## App Tracker

### Overview

This is a job tracking application where job applicants can keep track of the different applications they've submitted, and the various actions they've taken in regards to said applications (e-mails, communications, meetings, interviews, etc.)

### Technical Specs

This app was built using ReactJS.

It uses a Rails API with a PostgreSQL database for the back end. The API can be found [here](https://app-tracker-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/), and documentation for the API can be found in its GitHub README [here](https://github.com/achasveachas/app-tracker)

This project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The styling for this app was bootstrapped using [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/)

### Usage

This app can be found at https://app-tracker-react.herokuapp.com/.

Signing up for an account is free, no e-mail address is needed, you don't even have to provide your name (though some of the aesthetics may suffer).
